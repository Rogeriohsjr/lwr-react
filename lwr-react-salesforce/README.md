# Project to Test LWR with ThirdParty JS and Apex Call

[x] 1. Test Simple LWR and Apex Class
[x] 2. Add ThirdParty Library
[x] 3. Add ThirdParty Library to call Apex Class

# Some Things to keep in mind

- We can get element from the page
- We can load third party library
- We can call apex class from ThirdParty Library

# What we cannot do:

- We cannot call straight the apex class from Javascript, we have to pass the ApexClass to a method to have that reference there.
